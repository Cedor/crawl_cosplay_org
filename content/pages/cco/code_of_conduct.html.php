<h2>CCO Code of Conduct</h2>
<pre>
To help provide a safe and fun environment for everyone, please read this
document and follow all rules while connected to this public DCSS server.

Users of CCO in violation of the Code of Conduct may have their accounts 
suspended temporarily or indefinitely (with little to no notice).

   1. Be courteous to other players. Harassment will not be tolerated.

   2. Don't use obscene account names.

   3. Don't use account names, or chat messages to send spam or advertisements
      for unrelated content. Advertising your Dungeon Crawl content is encouraged.

   4. Do not attempt to steal or break into user accounts that don't belong to you.

   5. Abuse of the system is not acceptable. This includes the following:
       * Running chat bots without prior consent from an administrator
       * Engaging in any attack which degrades the performance of the server

      These actions can negatively impact server performance and affect the
      online experience for other players. Use good judgement to determine whether
      something is abusive. If you aren't sure, contact an administrator first.
      Abusive users will be banned without warning.

   6. Please do not use anonymizing services to evade bans, or to engage in abuse
      or other unkind behavior.

This code of conduct was written in good faith to preserve a fun atmosphere
and a functioning server environment, so that all players can enjoy the game.
