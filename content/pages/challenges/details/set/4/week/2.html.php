<h2>Set 4, Week 2: Bai Suzhen, Madame White Snake</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>Species</dt> <dd>Draconian</dd>
	<dt>Background</dt> <dd>Gladiator (with quarterstaff)</dd>
	<dt>God</dt> <dd>Fedhas or Qazlal</dd>
</dl>
<p>
(The Species, Background, and God choices are all mandatory. You must be worshipping one of the gods listed above before entering Lair, Orc, or Depths, unless this isn't possible in which case you must worship them as soon as you can. Don't do anything to lose your religion, and don't use faded altars.)</p>
 
<h4>Milestones</h4>
<p>The main way to score points. +5 points each, and can be done in any order. (You don't need to tell me which milestones you achieve.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Reach XL3.
<li>Enter Lair, Orc, or Depths.
<li>Reach the bottom of D, Lair, or Orc.
<li>Collect your first rune.
<li>Find the entrance to Zot. (Just using magic mapping doesn't count.)
<li>Collect your third rune.
<li>Win the game.
</ul>
 
<h4>Cosplay conduct points</h4>
<p>Optional. +5 points each, to a maximum of half your score from milestones, rounded down. (So if you achieve 4 milestones (20 points) you can earn up to 10 points from conduct bonuses.) Please indicate which conducts you qualify for when you post your morgue. Small mistakes in following conducts will usually be forgiven.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt> <dd>Train only Fighting, Staves, Unarmed Combat, and Throwing for weapon skills.</dd>
<dt>Magic</dt> <dd>Don't learn or cast any necromancy spells.</dd>
<dt>Evocations</dt> <dd>Have three different rechargeable evocables in your inventory. (Possible items: lamp of fire, phial of floods, fan of gales, lightning rod, and the Horn of Geryon.)</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Bonus challenges</h4>
<p>Optional. Each worth one star, similar to banners in Crawl tournaments. Please indicate challenges that you qualify for. Small mistakes will usually be forgiven.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Tempestuous</dt><dd>Reach skill level 27 in invocations, before you reach XL27. (Sorry agentoutlier! I'm moving away from these for the future but there will still be a couple once in a while.)</dd>
<dt>The Dragon Experience</dt> <dd> Be in dragon form from the time you enter Zot onward, and win the game. You don't have to be in dragon form for resting/auto-travel/running away/etc.
If you collect at least 4 runes and still don't have access to dragon form, you can enter Zot anyhow. In this case you must fight unarmed with no shield, but you can use other form-changing transmutation spells. If you find a book with dragon form while in Zot, you must switch to using it. Please don't try to game this exception by intentionally avoiding spellbooks, etc.</dd>
