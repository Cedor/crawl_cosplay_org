<dl>
	<dt>Species</dt>
		<dd>Mummy or Ghoul</dd>
	<dt>Background</dt>
		<dd>Any</dd>
	<dt>God</dt>
		<dd>Kikubaaqudgha or Yredelemnul</dd>
</dl>

<p>(The Species, Background, and God choices are all mandatory. You must be worshipping one of the gods listed above before entering Lair, Orc, or Depths, unless this isn't possible in which case you must worship them as soon as you can. Don't do anything to lose your religion, and don't use faded altars.)</p>
 
<h4>Milestones</h4>
<p>The main way to score points. +5 points each, and can be done in any order. (You don't need to tell me which milestones you achieve.)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Reach XL3.
	<li>Enter Lair, Orc, or Depths.
	<li>Reach the bottom of D, Lair, or Orc.
	<li>Collect your first rune.
	<li>Find the entrance to Zot. (Just using magic mapping doesn't count.)
	<li>Collect your third rune.
	<li>Win the game.
</ul>
 
<h4>Cosplay conduct points</h4>
<p>Optional. +5 points each, to a maximum of half your score from milestones, rounded down. (So if you achieve 4 milestones (20 points) you can earn up to 10 points from conduct bonuses.) Please indicate which conducts you qualify for when you post your morgue. Small mistakes in following conducts will usually be forgiven.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Species</dt>
		<dd>Play a Mummy</dd>
	<dt>Branch</dt>
		<dd>Enter the Tomb. You don't need to do anything there.</dd>
	<dt>Undead</dt>
		<dd>Always have Necromancy (with Kiku) or Invocations (with Yred) as your highest skill, when you have any skills higher than skill level 10. If you die before you have any skills higher than 10, you still must have Necro/Invo as your highest skill to get the points for this conduct.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Bonus challenges</h4>
<p>Optional. Each worth one star, similar to banners in Crawl tournaments. Please indicate challenges that you qualify for. Small mistakes will usually be forgiven.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Re-Animator</dt>
		<dd>Collect a rune with at least 48 undead allies in LOS. Take a screenshot or make a note with : !cosplay.
If there are no other creatures in sight, pressing ctrl-X should show you undead allies all the way to capital V. Also, 48 allies makes a 7x7 square with you somewhere in the middle. (There's no requirement for them to be in a square though, that's just a helpful visual guide.)</dd>
	<dt>The True Pharaoh</dt>
		<dd>Get all 6 runes that aren't from Pan or Hell, and win the game.</dd>
</dl>
