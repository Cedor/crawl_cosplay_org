<h2 style="color:rgb(69, 136, 5);">About Crawl Cosplay Sudden Death Challenges (CCSDC)</h2>

<p>The Crawl Cosplay Sudden Death Challenges is a competition that aims to fill a
Crawl niche not currently filled by the biannual version release tournaments or other Crawl Cosplays.
The idea is for players to compete by trying to do as well as possible in a
game of Crawl with one attempt only; if you die, that challenge is over (thus
"sudden death", though you may&mdash;<em>will</em>&mdash;also die suddenly). This competition is
a lower time commitment event that aims to challenge players while playing one of the 100 or so Crawl Unique characters.</p>

<h2>Competition Format</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each challenge consists of playing a Crawl Unique combo.</li>
<li>You get <em>one</em>  attempt to play each combo.</li>
<li>The goal is to advance as far as possible (and win!) in each game, scoring
points by reaching various in-game milestones.</li>
<li>Only games played and milestones scored between 00:00 UTC on the start and end dates count.</li>
<li>Details on rules and scoring are available on the <a href="rules.html">rules page</a>.</li>
</ul>
